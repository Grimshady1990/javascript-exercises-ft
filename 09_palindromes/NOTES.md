# Introduction

These are notes for assignment 09_palindromes.
The goal is to return all palindromes as true.

# Problems

The problems while trying to accomplish this goal are as follows.

- case sensitivity is going to be a problem, we must make all letters the same case.

- punctuation is a problem all punctuation must be removed.

- spaces are also going to cause a problem and need to be removed

# Plan

- Create a variable that makes all letters lowercase

- Create a variable that converts our string into an array

- Create a variable that removes all punctuation and spaces

- Create a variable that stores the array in reverse order

- Create a if statement that checks if the reverse array is equal to the original
