# Introduction

This assignment will find the the fibonacci based on which choice we make if we choose 8 it will find the 8th fibonacci number in the sequence.

# Problems 

The problems we have to solve are as follows.

- Working out the logic to create the sequences 
- Use of a for loop to run through the sequence
- Must only return the last number in the sequence
- Zero must return zero
- negative numbers must produce a error
- Numbers equal to two or less then one equal one
- numbers as strings must be accepted

# Pseudo Code

// IF zero or "zero" is equal to zero, return zero

// IF number is a string convert to number

// IF number is less than zero return "OOPS"

// IF number is equal too one return one

// CREATE variables (a) = 1, (b) = 0, (result) = ,

// FOR i equal to 0, if i is less than number, add one to i

// LOOP result equals a plus b, b = a, a = result
